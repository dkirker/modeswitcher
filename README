Mode Switcher is a webOS application that brings profile support for devices
running webOS in the form of "modes". These "modes" can control nearly every
available setting in webOS and they can be triggered (manually or automatically)
by a number of different methods or "triggers" that in turn change settings on
your device based on the configuration of the modes you created. Mode Switcher
is very powerful and feature rich. You can make its use as simple or complex as
you would need.
